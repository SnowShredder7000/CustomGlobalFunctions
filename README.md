# CustomGlobalFunctions
Make your own custom functions without having to define them first

How does it work?
You create a lua function as you normally would, and then you use the library function to make it global. Now you can use it without defining it.

Why release this if it's so easy to make and small?
I simply wanted to release something and incase anybody just don't wanna bother writing it themselfs.
